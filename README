This is the client-side half of the myFlix app, which will display information about movies to users directed from the movie_API, which I have hosted on heroku.
This will be an online-hosted, single-page, responsive app with several views and a polished user experience. 

Different views are:
  Login/Signup View to create an account or log in.
  Main View displaying filtered list of movies where users can search, add movies to favorites, and expand movies to display more info.
  Profile view showing user favorites, and allowing users to update account info/delete account.

Dependencies:
  node
  npm
  parcel
  bootstrap
  react
  react-bootstrap
  react-router
  react-dom
